Circumference and area of a circleWrite a program containing two functions to calculate the circumference and area of a circledefined by its radius. Test it using user input.Here are some tips for solving this exercise:•Circumference and area calculation formulas should be part of your secondary schoolmemories... Or a Google click away :)•The value of number π (Pi) is obtained withMath.PIin JavaScript.•You might want to use theexponentiation operator²**to perform computations.
